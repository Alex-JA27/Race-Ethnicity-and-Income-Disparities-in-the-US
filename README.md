**Race, Ethnicity, and Income Disparities in the U.S.**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Overview**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project explores the socioeconomic disparities that exist across different racial and ethnic groups in the United States, with a focus on income inequality and its connection to systemic barriers in education, employment, and housing. The goal is to identify patterns that reveal how race and ethnicity continue to shape economic opportunity in the U.S.
By analyzing national datasets, the project seeks to promote a data-driven understanding of equity issues and inspire actionable policy solutions that address structural inequality.

**Objectives**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Examine how income levels vary across racial and ethnic groups.

- Identify regional patterns or urban-rural divides in income inequality.

- Explore correlations between education, employment, and income across demographics.
  
- Provide visual and statistical evidence to support discussions on equity and inclusion.

**Motivation**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Despite decades of policy efforts, racial and ethnic disparities in income persist. Understanding the data behind inequality is a critical step toward creating fairer opportunities for all communities. This project aims to make that data accessible and insightful for researchers, policymakers, and the public.

**Methodology**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Data Collection: Public datasets from the U.S. Census Bureau and the American Community Survey (ACS) were used.
2. Data Cleaning & Preparation: Missing or inconsistent values were handled to ensure accuracy.
3. Statistical Analysis: Measures of central tendency, income distributions, and correlation coefficients were computed.
4. Visualization: Graphs and charts illustrate key disparities and patterns by race, ethnicity, and region.

**Key Findings**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Persistent income gaps exist between White, Black, and Hispanic households across nearly all states.
- Educational attainment strongly influences income, but disparities remain even at higher education levels.
- Geographic inequality plays a significant role, with certain regions showing more pronounced racial income divides.

**Impact**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This analysis highlights the intersection between race, opportunity, and economic mobility. By making disparities visible through data, the project encourages deeper reflection and evidence-based action toward equity and inclusion in American society.
